# Face recogniser

## 1. Purpose

Small hobby project to learn how to use face recognition, both using OpenCV to capture video and to detect faces, and then to use these faces to determine who they belong to.

## 2. Goal

The goal is to create a program that captures video from my webcam, automatically recognises my face (and maybe my eyes), and evaluates whether this is me (or maybe a friend or family member).
